# Tether

## Introduction

Tethers are essential in the field of underwater robotics. Indeed, they allow the transit of information and energy between different multi-marine objects. This is why it is important to know how to simulate them to understand their behavior and to be able to predict the areas in which the tether is located, to avoid navigation in these parts.
